# Introduction #

Ajax Animator 0.21, 0.22, 0.23, 0.24, 0.25 and up.

# Details #

The next revision will focus on collaboration, saving to server, moving to cloud hosting (App Engine), scalability, speed, and users.

Onlypaths will get cross-platform (IE) support, the wrapper will be improved (no fill, opacity, z-index). Possibly switch to dojo.gfx renderer?

Offline support, Gears, etc.

Improved export to Flash/Silverlight/JavaFX. More export formats?

Better help, interective tutorials?

Login system. either OpenID or simple ajax-animator centric login (i promise it'll be quick though). If not OpenID, then registration will require only username, password, password (again), and pressing "Register"
